# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

## These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.

## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an
HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.

## LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE

### When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML //<script>// element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

## PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE

You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files).

## JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHERE IT IS FOUND IN THE HTML
When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to
load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.


- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.


## STATEMENTS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

## COMMENTS

You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?

A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.

## DATA TYPES

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans.
