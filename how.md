# How does the computer works ?

## It take input, then store information, process the information and show the output, and that’s what makes a computer, computer.Computer started as a basic calculator. 

## Types of input :
- Keyboard 
- Mouse 
- Mic
- Touch screen 
- Sensors …

## The input information stored in the storage then the processor take them and process them to show output.

## The output could be a text, image, video, games, VR or signals to control the robot

## The binary number system

The binary system use  or zero to represent data for example number 9 is equal to 1001 and this bcame by (1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1).
Text represented by 1 and 0 also as every letter have its own binary code.

## Logic circuit consists of something called logic gates  which are AND ,NAND,NOT,NOR,OR,XOR and by combing these gates we can make ADDER which can add two numbers and so on.

## The computer uses the CPU to process the information and the RAM to store them temporary and finally send them to the output device like , screen , speaker , printer , robots … etc

## The hardware could be circuits , chips , stuff plugs ,wires …etc
### The software tells the cpu what to do.
### The operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
