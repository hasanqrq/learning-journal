# JAVASCRIPT

## A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

1: DEFINE THE GOAL
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.

3: CODE EACH STEP
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight
away, it pays to spend time designing your script
before you start writing it.


## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value
Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.

### EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.

### Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.




### There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

### A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

### Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
