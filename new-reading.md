# Design HTML and CSS

## PROCCESS AND DESIGN

### WE HAVE TO ANSWER SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS  WHEN WE DESIGN A WEBSITE 

- Who is the Site For?

- Why People Visit
YOUR Website?

- What Your Visitors are
Trying to Achieve?

### First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. You can then assign the list of tasks to the fictional visitors you created in the step described on the previous page.

- What Information
Your Visitors Need ?

### You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

- How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site ?

 ### Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

 ## Site Maps

 ### Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

 ## Wireframes

 ### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

 ####  You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.


## visual hierarchy
### Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to findinformation. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for

#### Grouping
##### groups showing you what the services do, the costs involved and some of the services' users.

#### Similarity
##### All of the links in the body text are in blue so it is clear what text is clickable

#### Images
##### Images create a high visual contrast and often attract the eye first. They can be used todraw attention to a specific message within the page. In some cases, the right image can succinctly reveal more than an entire page of text.

## grouping and Similarity


### When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend.


## Designing Navigation

### Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles...

 
# summary ofPROCESS & Design
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
-  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
-  Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
 
# HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
-the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# Comments in HTML

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
(<!-- and -->) markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The (<div>) and (<span>) elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- (<iframes>) cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The (<meta>) tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
